# Online Store Management System

The Online Store Management System is a web-based application that allows store owners to manage their online store. The application is built using Spring Boot and uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure the RESTful API endpoints.

## Features

1. [User registration and login](#user-registration-and-login)
2. [Role-based access control](#role-based-access-control)
3. [Product management](#product-management)
4. [Order management](#order-management)
5. [Shopping cart](#shopping-cart)
6. [Payment gateway integration](#payment-gateway-integration)
7. [Product search](#product-search)
8. [Order history](#order-history)

## Technical Requirements

* The backend of the application should be built using Spring Boot.
* The application should use JWT authentication to secure the RESTful API endpoints.
* The data should be stored in a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
* The frontend of the application can be built using any modern JavaScript framework such as React, Vue.js, or Angular.
* The application should follow the RESTful API design principles and should use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with the data.
